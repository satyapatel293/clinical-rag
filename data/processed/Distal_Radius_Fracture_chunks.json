In addition, further investigation \non the optimal timing, duration, and content of rehabilitation \nprotocols to enhance functional recovery would facilitate the \ndelivery of more tailored and effective care for these individuals.

Evidence supporting the addition of other edema \ncontrol methods to a standard treatment regimen is limited. Evidence from 2 level II studies105,149 and 1 level III study104 \nsuggests that the addition of specific MLD techniques may \nhave short-term benefits for hand volume.99 Similarly, 1 level \nII study204 found that adding a custom-made compression \nglove improved swelling, AROM, pain and function com-\npared to a standard 6-week protocol. No harm directly related \nto treatment was reported in any of the studies reviewed. Gaps in Knowledge\nHigher-level studies are needed to investigate the potential \nbenefits of MLD.

case series studies\nPrognostic Studies\nPredictors: demographic (age, sex, education level, socioeconomic \nstatus, BMI, living/marital status), health (comorbid burden), injury-­\nrelated (high vs

issues (pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, fear of move-\nment), polypharmacy (≥4 medications) OR number of medications\nOutcomes: Pain (CRPS or non-CRPS), function, wrist/hand ROM, \nstrength, dexterity, return to work, or any other wrist/hand/upper \nextremity-related outcome that is meaningful to physical therapy \npractice and amenable to PT interventions (eg, risk of contrac-\ntures, risk for future falls or fall-related injuries), physical activity, \ndevelopment of CTS or nerve dysfunction\nInterventions\nStudies for which the primary aim was to investigate the efficacy of \nvarious interventions that clinicians (PTs and OTs) may commonly \nutilize during the rehabilitation of DRF following either nonoperative \nor operative fracture management. These interventions included \nthe decisions on therapy initiation timing and therapy supervision \ndosage levels. Other types of intervention categories within the scope \nof physical therapy practice consisted of edema control (MLD and \ncompression gloves), manual therapy techniques (Maitland, Kalten-\nborn, and MWM joint mobilization techniques), therapeutic exercises \n(ROM and strengthening exercises), SM training exercises (sensory \nre-education, proprioception, and GMI), orthosis management (static \nprogressive and dynamic), and numerous therapeutic modalities \n(thermal, light-emitting, electrical, and mechanical agents).",
