Further, \nmany of these guidance documents have targeted specific \npopulations (eg, athletes and military personnel) in specific \ncare contexts (eg, sideline assessments and return-to-activ­\nity decision making).34,159 The lack of guidance for manage­\nment of a wider scope of patients is particularly problematic \nfor physical therapists, as they may encounter patients with \nconcussions from a variety of injury mechanisms and con­\ntexts (eg, children injured in recreational activities, military \npersonnel in active-duty service, older adults after falls, or \npassengers in motor vehicle collisions).

This \nfast-paced evolution of evidence likely contributes to varia­\ntion in care, which in turn adds to the difficulty in defining \nnatural concussion recovery trajectories and the extent to \nwhich various strategies directly affect outcomes.107,108\nGaps in Knowledge\nMore research is needed to determine risk factors related to \npoor recovery from concussion and how timing and utiliza­\ntion of physical therapy services may affect recovery. --- Page 17 ---\nCOLUMN 1:\nsensitivity to light and sound, fatigue, disorientation, mental \nfogginess, sleep disturbances, and difficulty regulating emo­\ntions, among others.41,107,142 Many studies report that most \nindividuals who sustain a concussion “recover” within a rel­\natively short period of time (approximately 7-14 days post \ninjury).34,41,102 However, definitions for concussion and the \nstrategies to measure recovery have been inconsistent.102,107 \nIn recent years, the notion that most individuals recover fully \nfrom concussion within a few days or weeks has been increas­\ningly challenged.34,102,159 Studies have demonstrated that as \nmany as 5% to 58%96,107 of individuals who sustain a concus­\nsion have persistent symptoms, impairments, and/or limita­\ntions that affect daily function.",
