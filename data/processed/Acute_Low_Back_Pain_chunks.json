KEY POINTS FOR PATIENT EDUCATION\nAcute LBP\n•\t Active patient education strategies, including information \non biopsychosocial contributors to pain and self-manage­\nment techniques, have evidence that they reduce pain and \ndisability in patients with acute LBP. Chronic LBP\n•\t Patient education should not be used as a stand-alone \ntreatment to reduce pain and disability in patients with \nchronic LBP, but can be combined with other interventions \nsuch as exercise and manual therapy. Postoperative LBP\n•\t Patient education has primarily been studied post lumbar \ndecompression or discectomy surgery. •\t No evidence supports education for patients undergoing \nother surgical procedures (eg, spinal fusion).",
