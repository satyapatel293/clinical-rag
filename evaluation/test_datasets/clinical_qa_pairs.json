However, autonomic dysfunction \nresulting from the brain injury itself may be a contributing \nfactor.9,15,33,123,133 It has been hypothesized that concussions \ncan lead to an uncoupling of the central autonomic nervous \nsystem and the heart, leading to a reduced ability to maintain \nand adjust cerebral blood flow, blood pressure, and/or heart \nrate in response to increases and decreases in physical exer\u00ad\ntion.15,53,66,85,133 While confirmatory studies for these hypoth\u00ad\neses are needed, preliminary work in this area suggests that \nconcussions may be associated with altered autonomic regu\u00ad\nlation.17,65,66,85 This autonomic dysregulation has been linked \nto higher perceived rates of exertion after concussion in com\u00ad\nparison to individuals who have not recently sustained a con\u00ad\ncussion,85 and may be captured by assessments for orthostatic \nhypotension.187 Another potential source of poor tolerance of \nphysical exertion is general deconditioning or secondary phys\u00ad\nical inactivity/lifestyle changes that may be recommended or \noccur as a result of the concussive injury.191,192,204\nMotor Function Impairments\nA variety of studies have reported that individuals who have \nexperienced a concussive event may present with altered mo\u00ad\ntor function abilities, including static and dynamic balance/\n Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy\u00ae \nDownloaded from www.jospt.org at on July 2, 2025.",
