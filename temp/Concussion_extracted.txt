identified?
(sidebar 1)
Yes
Develop individualized goals and a physical therapy plan of care that
• Addresses specific impairment areas identified during the examination
• Matches patient’s level of irritability in those areas
• Incorporates plans for delayed examination tests
• Includes plans for regular reassessments and outcome measure administration
• Considers the patient’s values, preferences, and priorities
• Aligns with the patient’s indicators for self-management (sidebar 2)
• Integrates injury prevention and brain health promotion strategies (sidebar 3)
Implement, adjust, and progress plan in the following ways:
• Provide individualized targeted interventions for identified impairment areas
• Match interventions and dosing to level of irritability in those areas
• Monitor symptoms and identified impairments at every session
• Periodically assess/reassess all impairment domains and selected outcome
measures and adjust/progress plan of care as indicated
• Monitor mental health, patient’s recovery mindset, and patient/family barriers,
preferences, and priorities and adjust plan of care to accommodate as indicated
• Incorporate injury prevention and brain health promotion strategies (sidebar 3)
